# Running the DummyCameraApp

### Note this README assumes you are using Ubuntu, as to mimic running this on the Base NUC

1. Make sure you have Qt 6.5 and QtCreator installed (and make sure that QtQuick is included in that installation)
2. Open this app in QtCreator by selecting "Open project" and selecting the CMakeLists.txt file in the file explorer that's opened
3. Make sure that the [OpenCVServer.py](../../rover-development/DummyCameraAppServer/OpenCVServer.py) app is running (Check the server's [README](../../rover-development/DummyCameraAppServer/README.md))
4. Hit Ctrl + R to run the app

How this program works:

Currently, the driver reads from the file, one line at a time
It then sends one line at a time to the server

The driver acts as a publisher
the server acts as a broker

After the server recieves the information, it then forwards the information to the client
THe client reads this data, and interprets it for whatever use it's needed

Questions:
CUrrently, I am sending one line at a time, how does UDP communication typically handle this?
Server reads the data, and stores it into a char buffer, should it be struct?
Should we be sending data with a struct?
Finally, should there be a message to verify the communication, or should I just run the driver
and server, having the driver send whenever, and the server always listening?


publisher -> server -> client
Since there is only one publisher, server client, is topic needed?
I feel as though topic should be used to say how many lines are being read
